Shop are locations in the main hub where players can purchase 
valuable items to help them progress in the game

There will be no designated weapon shops as weapons are crafted. 

Shops:
	- Utility Shop:
		- players can buy consumable items here such as replenishing potions and buff potions
	- Material Shop
		- players can buy materials that can help them craft weapons
	- Drip Shop
		- players can buy cosmetics here.
		- as Drip is cosmetic only, this shop will be refreshed every so often with random cosmetics.
		- The player should check here every so often for new cosmetics. This will hopefully give the players
		  the capability of keeping their look fresh if they so desire.
	- Crafting Station
