Inventory Design

The inventory system in Monster Grind is separated into distinct sub categoires. The player
can then move to separate categories by pressing the tab label at the top of a given page.

Tab Inventory 

Category Tabs:
	- Weapons : Tab dedicated to storing weapons
		Weapons are equippable items designed for players to use in dealing damage to enemies. 
		They are categorized into three primary archetypes: Warrior, Mage, and Rogue, each featuring 
		unique weapon subcategories to suit different playstyles.

		Weapons are non-stackable and treated as individual entities 
		within the inventory. Each weapon is considered a distinct item, ensuring that specific attributes, enhancements, 
		or unique characteristics are preserved for every instance.
				
	- Recipes : Tab dedicated to storing weapon recipes
		Recipes are collectible documents that outline the required crafting materials to 
		create specific weapons. They serve as a unique type of consumable; when consumed, 
		they unlock access to a designated page within the player's recipe compendium. 
		This page allows the player to view detailed information about the necessary materials 
		for crafting the associated weapon.

		To craft a weapon at the weaponsmith, the player must first obtain the corresponding recipe. 
		Recipes not only guide the crafting process but also act as a progression system, encouraging 
		exploration and resource management.
		
	- Accessories : Tab dedicated to storing accessories
		Accessories are equippable items that provide bonuses to the player's stats, 
		enhancing their performance and capabilities in various ways. They are divided 
		into three distinct categories: Hats, Amulets, and Necklaces, each offering unique 
		benefits tailored to different playstyles.

		These accessories add a layer of customization, allowing players to optimize their characterâ€™s 
		build and adapt to diverse challenges.
				
	- Drip : Tab decdicated to storing wear
		Drip refers to equippable cosmetic items that allow players to customize their character's 
		appearance without affecting gameplay. These items are purely aesthetic, enabling players to 
		express their unique style and creativity. Drip items are categorized into four types: 
		Shirts, Pants, Shoes, and Overalls, offering a wide range of combinations to achieve the perfect look.
		
	- Consumables : Tab dedicated for usable items such as potions, food , etc.
		Consumables are items designed to restore or enhance the player's capabilities in various ways. 
		They include potions that replenish vital resources such as HP or MP, as well as cures that remove 
		negative effects. Additionally, consumables can take the form of food that grants special effects, 
		including temporary buffs or, in some cases, debuffs, adding an element of strategic decision-making 
		to their use.
		
	- Materials : Tab dedicated for storing materials.
		Materials are items essential for crafting equipment, completing quests, 
		or fulfilling specific objectives. While some materials serve as critical 
		components in creating powerful gear or progressing in the story, others 
		are categorized as valuables, which players can sell to shops or trade with others for currency. 
		This dual-purpose functionality adds depth to the player's resource management and economic 
		decisions.
Other:
	
	- Currency counter display at bottom
		Currency is the primary medium of exchange used to purchase items across all categories, 
		with the exception of certain untradeable items. It plays a vital role in the economy, 
		enabling players to acquire resources, equipment, and upgrades. Additionally, 
		crafting weapons at the weaponsmith requires the player to pay a fee, adding a strategic 
		layer to resource management.
