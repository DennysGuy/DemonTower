description = "Wands are efficient magic-casting weapons with a respectable casting speed, making them the faster option within the Mageâ€™s arsenal. While they sacrifice a bit of range and raw magic attack power compared to staffs, wands excel in agility and quick casting. This makes them ideal for Mages who prefer faster spell execution and a more dynamic combat style, trading off a small amount of reach and power for speed and versatility."
