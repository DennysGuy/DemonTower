# Monster Grind
Monster Grind is a hardcore Action RPG masquerading as a casual game where players embrace the grind to conquer a towering dungeon. As a custom-built adventurer, your task is to battle monsters, gather rare crafting materials, and forge increasingly powerful weapons to defeat each floor's boss and unlock the next level of the tower. With a leveling system inspired by classic MapleStory, progression is deliberately challenging, rewarding patience and skill. Monster Grind will be developed in the Godot Game Engine.
